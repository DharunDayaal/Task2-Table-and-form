The Tables in HTML are used to visualize the contents in the form of rows and columns by using the tags(th, tr, td). 
The forms are used in websites to get data from the user to use to future applications.
I used some CSS styles to arrange and aligin  the items by using selectoors like tags, classes and ID's and for aligining the items i uses the flex container and justified them accordingly.
